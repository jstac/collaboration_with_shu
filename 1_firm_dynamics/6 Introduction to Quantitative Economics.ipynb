    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Shortest paths\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Importance of spp\n",
    "\n",
    "The shortest path problem is a famous topic in dynamic programming that has applications in artificial intelligence, operations research, network design and other areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is not a standard building block for economic modelling, it clearly illustrates the Bellman's principle of optimality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Aim of the spp\n",
    "\n",
    "The **aim** of the spp is to traverse a graph, following arcs (arrows) from one specified node to another at minimum cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrows indicate the movements we can take, and numbers on the arcs indicate the cost of traveling along them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.3 Solution to the spp\n",
    "\n",
    "For small spp, we can find the optimal paths by eyeballing the graph. For large graphs, we need a systematic solution. Before we develop the systematic solution, we should define the spp clearly by some definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Def. (cost-to-go function/Value function)\n",
    "\n",
    "A function $v(x)$ is called the **minimium cost-to-go function** or **value function** if $v(x)$ is the total cost of traveling to the final node from node $x$ when we take the best (least-cost) route.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computing the least cost path, given $v$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that $v(x)$ is a known cost-to-go function from node $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start at $A$ and from then on, at node $x$, move to the node $y$ that solves\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{y \\in \\Gamma(x)} \\{ c(x, y) + v(y) \\} \\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Gamma (x)$: the set of nodes that can be reached from $x$ in one step;\n",
    "\n",
    "$c(x,y)$: the cost of traveling from $x$ to $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Idea behind\n",
    "\n",
    "When the function $v$ is given, to minimize the cost-to-go, we choose the next step to minimise current cost plus remaining cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Find $v$ by the Bellman equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $v$ can be solved by the Bellmand equation\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v(x) = \\min_{y \\in \\Gamma(x)} \\{ c(x, y) + v(y) \\} \\tag{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which holds for every node $x$ in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Remark\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The unknown object in this equation is the function $v$, and the Bellman equation provides a restriction on that object so that we can pin down the function.\n",
    "2. The Bellman equation holds for almost all shortest path problems (**What is the special case?**).\n",
    "3. Alternative versions of the equation hold for a vast array of recursive problems.\n",
    "4. The solution to the nonlinear Bellman equation can be uniquely defined and relatively easy to calculate, when the graph is not too large and satisfies some regularity properties (**what are they?**)."

    "\n",
    "##### Dynamic programming is a two-step procedure:\n",

    "States in the spp were locations, or nodes in the graph. The states for the job search problem are employment and unemployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current choice choice (accept or reject) not only affects current reward (one period wage or unemployment compensation), but also the next period state.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Optimal action\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimally trade off current and future rewards, we need to compare two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the current payoffs we get from our two choices;\n",
    "2. the states that those choices will lead to and the maximum amount of value that can be extracted from those states.\n",

    "Then, consider the maximum lifetime value that can be realised when entering the current period unemployed but with wage offer $w$ in hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Denote this unknown value by $v^*(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of $v^*$ as a function that assigns to each possible wage $w$ the maximal lifetime value that can be obtained with that offer in hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial observation is that this function $v^*$ should satisfy the recursion (a version of the Bellman equation)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v^*(w) = \\max{\\{ \\frac{w}{1 - \\beta}, c + \\beta \\int v^*(w')q(w')dw' \\}} \\tag{12}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "at every $w \\in \\mathbb R_+$.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Intuition seasoning behind [(12)](#):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first term inside the max operation is the *stopping value*, corresponding to the lifetime payoff from accepting current offer $w$.\n",
    "2. The second term inside the max operation is the continuation value, which is the current value of the lifetime payoff from rejecting the current offer and then bahaving optimally in all subsequent periods.\n",
    "3. The best choice in the present period is the largest of these two alternatives.\n",
    "4. if we pick the best of these alternatives, then, since our current choice is optimal and our next period value is calculated based on optimal future choice, we should obtain maximal lifetime value from today, given current offer $w$.\n",
    "5. The maximal lifetime value is precisely $v^*(w)$, and we have the LHS=RHS of [(12)](#).\n",
    "\n",
    "(PS: I want the line of thinking associated with dynamic programming to become my second nature.)\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Remark\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we think of [(12)](#): as an equation, then we can potentially solve for $v^*$, which will then allow us to make optimal choices in the matter described above.\n",
    "2. One new thing: the unknown object in this equation [(12)](#) is not a number or a vector but rather an entire function, that is, the value of $v^*(w)$ at any possible $w$, which is also nonlinear.\n",
    "3. We should also consider the existence of a (valid) solution by using the connections between fixed-point theory and dynamic programming."

    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In order to answer these questions, we need to make assumptions about how the interest rate and non-financial income evolve, and how the households believe they will evolve (Beliefs about financial and non-financial income affect the savings-consumption decision, which flows into [(13)](#) through the presence of the choice variable $c_t$).\n",
    "2. Determining household consumption behavior at different levels of wealth and with different values of impulses and shocks is essential to understanding the evolution $\\{ w_t \\}$ in [(13)](#).\n",

    "While such an exercise might produce valuable insights, purely statistical approaches are inherently backward looking (Because we are unable to time travel prior to collecting our data).\n",

    "Consumption at $c_t$ is not allowed to depend on information unavailable at $t$, such as the values $\\eta_{t+1}, \\eta_{t+2}, ...$. Rather, consumption can depend only on past and current information:\n",

    "In practice, we take current consumption $c_t$ to be a function of shocks, states and actions observed until and including time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stands to reason, since current consumption must react to past and present shocks that constrain or enhence consumption possibilities. In engineering, this mapping from the history of the state and shocks into current actionis is called a **closed loop control**. In Economics, it is called a **policy function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, the optimal consumption policy depends only on the current state when that state is set to $(w_t, z_t)$ (Shown by using Markov Chain?). In other words, under the optimal policy, current consumption $c_t$ is a function of current assets and the current realisation of the shock. It has no additional dependence on earlier values. \n",

    "Moreover, the fact that the problem has an infinite horizon and the structure is unchanging can be used to show that this optimal policy is **stationary**, in the sense that the mapping from current state to current consumption does not change over time.

    "\n",
    "1. The Bellman equation tells us that to make the best current choice of consumption given current state $(w_0, z_0)= (w,z)$, one should optimally trade off current utility of consumption $u(c)$ vs. the expectd value of resulting next period assets, appropriately discounted.\n",
    "2. When we perform this trade off optimally, we attain maximal value from the current state, which is why the LHS of [(20)](#) is equal to $v^* (w,z)$.\n",

    "1. An n-vector $x$ is a tuple of $n$ real numbers: $x = (x_1,...,x_n)$ where $x_i \\in \\mathbb R$ for each $i$.\n",
    "\n",
